- Hardening

Protecting a system by which its vulnerability surface, which is stronger as a system perform more functions.

 - Server Hardening
 - Application Hardening
 - Database Hardening
---

# **Hardening**

- a collection of tools and techniques to reduce vulnerability in the infrastructure or the systems unlike test maturity model is emphasizing on the automation process
- provides different protection layers
  - host level
  - application level
  - operating system level
  - user level to physical level.

# **Criteria to assess security aspect of software development tools**

|Criteria | Description|
|---------------|----------------|
|Vulnerability|Any weakness in the system may damage the assets of the organizations|
|Data Leak Threat|- Human error <br/>- Machine error|
|Audit Logging|- All the activities should be recorded in details<br/>- Easier for analyst to review for any weakness|
|Identity and Access Management|Provide the right access, for the right people, at the right time|
|Security integrate with SDLC|Involve all the security measurement during the SDLC|
|Storage method|- Advanced Firewalls<br/>- Event Logging<br/>- Encryption|
|Attack Pattern|Identify and ensure the vulnerability can be prevented|
|Automate routine tasks|Implement automation to avoid human error|

# Methodology

**Methodology to assess software development tool security are such as below:**
- **NIST framework**
- **NICE framework**
- **SAST vs DAST**

---

## NIST framework

---

## NICE framework

---

## SAST vs DAST

| SAST | DAST|
|-------------------|------------------|
|White box security testing <br/>- Tester has access the underlying framework <br/>- Application tested from inside out <br/>- testing represent developer approach| Black box security testing<br/>- Tester has no knowledge of the framework or technologies <br/>-tested from outside in <br/>-testing represent hacker approach|

---

|SAST |DAST|
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Requires source code  -analyze source code or binary without executing the applications| Requires a running application -  analyze by executing the applications |
|Find vulnerabilities earlier in SDLC |Find vulnerabilities toward the end of SDLC|
|Less expensive to solve the vulnerabilities- problem can be solve before code enter to QA cycle| More expensive to solve the vulnerabilities -problem may be fixed as emergency release|
|can't discover run-time and environment-related issues scans static code| Can discover run-time and environment-related issues -using dynamic analysis|
|Support all kinds of software | Typically scan only application like web services and web application|
