---

# Maven Features

- Easier build process
- Quality project information
- Transparent migration to new features
- Best practices development guideline
- Uniform build system

---


# Scope
These are the scopes provided by Maven for developers to manage

- Build
- Documentation
- Reporting
- Dependencies
- SCMs
- Releases
- Distribution
- Mailing List

---

## Maven Goals

- Clean
- build
- Site

**Clean** and **Build** lifecycle is in used by Back End Repositories

---
# **Project Object Model (POM)**
- Fundamental unit of work in Maven
- Contains information about the project
- Store configuration details

---

# **Multi-Modules Project**

- Manage a group of submodules
- Located at project's root directory
- Submodules are regular Maven projects, can be built separately or with aggregator

---

# **Multi-Modules Project --> Parent**

- a POM which its content can be inherited
- 1 project/child POM can only have 1 Parent
- child declare parantage in its POM
- Parent is unaware of child that's inheriting
- useful when parent POM consist of reusable content for another project

---

# **Multi-Modules Project --> Aggregator**

- can sequence build process of many projects
- specifies all the projects that can be build-managed together
- child POM unaware of aggregator POM
- Aggregator POM can have more than 1 child POM
- no inheritance of any content from aggregator POM
- useful for modular build & site those projects that should be managed together

---

# **Maven Build Lifecycle**

There are 3 built-in build lifecycle
- Default
- Clean
- Site

---

- purposely designed for documentation
- useful for create reports, deploy site, and etc.

---

## **Maven Plugin**

All Maven tasks are done through plugins and it's used for:

- create jar file
- create war file
- compile code files
- unit testing of code
- create project documentation
- create project reports

---

## **Documentation for BackEnd Code**

By using Maven Site lifecycle, we can generate documentation for all BackEnd Codes

- Provide information on each Repositories
- Provide information on Dependencies
- Automate all site generation with the help of aggregator

---

## **Plugins for documentation**

- project info report
- maven site
- javadoc

---

## **Extra info**

The command for generate site was used as below due to error matching with Java snapshot:

- mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-site-plugin:3.7.1:site

7 repositories have to be took out as its Java code encountered error:

- dcp-core-utils
- dcp-retail-sdk
- dcp-cxf-lib-ibk
- dcp-cxf-lib-rsa
- dcp-data-repository
- dcp-eai-sdk
- dcp-identity-service
