# Apache Maven

- a comprehension and project management software tool.
- create, report and documentation of a project based on POM
- any Java-based project can be create and manage through maven.

![Maven and its Features](https://www.sevenmentor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Maven-Architecture-Training-in-Pune.jpg)

---

# Maven Features

- Easier build process
- Quality project information
- Transparent migration to new features
- Best practices development guideline
- Uniform build system

---


# Scope
These are the scopes provided by Maven for developers to manage

- Build
- Documentation
- Reporting
- Dependencies
- SCMs
- Releases
- Distribution
- Mailing List

---

## Maven Goals

- Clean
- build
- Site

**Clean** and **Build** lifecycle is in used by Back End Repositories

---
# **Project Object Model (POM)**
- Fundamental unit of work in Maven
- Contains information about the project
- Store configuration details

![Maven POM](https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Maven-POM-File-1.2.jpg)

---

# **Multi-Modules Project**

- Manage a group of submodules
- Located at project's root directory
- Submodules are regular Maven projects, can be built separately or with aggregator

---

# **Multi-Modules Project --> Parent**

- a POM which its content can be inherited
- 1 project/child POM can only have 1 Parent
- child declare parantage in its POM
- Parent is unaware of child that's inheriting
- useful when parent POM consist of reusable content for another project

---

# **Multi-Modules Project --> Aggregator**

- can sequence build process of many projects
- specifies all the projects that can be build-managed together
- child POM unaware of aggregator POM
- Aggregator POM can have more than 1 child POM
- no inheritance of any content from aggregator POM
- useful for modular build & site those projects that should be managed together

---

# **Maven Build Lifecycle**

There are 3 built-in build lifecycle
- Default
- Clean
- Site

---

|Phase|Handles|Description|	
|--|--|--|	
|**Prepare-resources**|Resource copying|Resource copying can be customized in this phase|	
|**Validate**|Validating the information	|Validates if the project is correct and if all necessary information is available.|	
|**Compile**|Compilation|Validates if the project is correct and if all necessary information is available.|	
|**Test**|Testing|Tests the compiled source code suitable for testing framework.|	
|**Package**|Packaging|This phase creates the JAR/WAR package as mentioned in the packaging in POM.xml.|	
|**Install**|Installation|This phase installs the package in local/remote maven repository.|	
|**Deploy**|Deploying|Copies the final package to the remote repository.|	

---

## **Maven Default Lifecycle**

![Maven Build Lifecycle](https://www.codetab.org/tutorial/apache-maven/media/mvn-plugins-package-goals.png)

---
|Sr.No.|Lifecycle Phase & Description|	
|--|--|	
|1|**Validate** - Validates whether project is correct and all necessary information is available to complete the build process.|	
|2|**Initialize** - Initializes build state, for example set properties.|	
|3|**Generate-Sources** - Generate any source code to be included in compilation phase.|	
|4|**Process-Sources** - Process the source code, for example, filter any value.|	
|5|**Generate-Resources** - Generate resources to be included in the package.|	
|6|**Process-Resources** - Copy and process the resources into the destination directory, ready for packaging phase.|	
|7|**Compile** - Compile the source code of the project.|	

---
|Sr.No.|Lifecycle Phase & Description|	
|--|--|	
|8|**Process-Classes** - Post-process the generated files from compilation, for example to do bytecode enhancement/optimization on Java classes.|	
|9|**Generate-Test-Sources** - Generate any test source code to be included in compilation phase.|	
|10|**Process-Test-Sources** - Process the test source code, for example, filter any values.|	
|11|**Test-Compile** - Compile the test source code into the test destination directory.|	
|12|**Process-Test-Classes** - Process the generated files from test code file compilation.|	
|13|**Test** - Run tests using a suitable unit testing framework (Junit is one).|	
|14|**Prepare-Package** - Perform any operations necessary to prepare a package before the actual packaging.|	

---
|Sr.No.|Lifecycle Phase & Description|	
|--|--|	
|15|**Package** - Take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR, WAR, or EAR file.|	
|16|**Pre-Integration-Test** - Perform actions required before integration tests are executed. For example, setting up the required environment.|	
|17|**Integration-Test** - Process and deploy the package if necessary into an environment where integration tests can be run.|	
|18|**Post-Integration-Test** - Perform actions required after integration tests have been executed. For example, cleaning up the environment.|	
|19|**Verify** - Run any check-ups to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria.|	
|20|**Install** - Install the package into the local repository, which can be used as a dependency in other projects locally.|	
|21|**Deploy** - Copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.|
---

## **Maven Clean Lifecycle**

- Clean the files and directories generated during build Process

![Maven Clean Lifecycle](https://www.studytonight.com/maven/images/build-lifecycle-clean-phase.jpg)


---

## **Maven Site Lifecycle**

- purposely designed for documentation
- useful for create reports, deploy site, and etc.

![Maven Site Lifecycle](https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Maven-Life-Cycle-4.png)

---

## **Maven Plugin**

All Maven tasks are done through plugins and it's used for:

- create jar file
- create war file
- compile code files
- unit testing of code
- create project documentation
- create project reports

---

## **Documentation for BackEnd Code**

By using Maven Site lifecycle, we can generate documentation for all BackEnd Codes

- Provide information on each Repositories
- Provide information on Dependencies
- Automate all site generation with the help of aggregator

---

## **Plugins for documentation**

- project info report
- maven site
- javadoc

---

## **Extra info**

The command for generate site was used as below due to error matching with Java snapshot:

- mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-site-plugin:3.7.1:site

---

## **Extra info**

7 repositories have to be took out as its Java code encountered error:

- dcp-core-utils
- dcp-retail-sdk
- dcp-cxf-lib-ibk
- dcp-cxf-lib-rsa
- dcp-data-repository
- dcp-eai-sdk
- dcp-identity-service
