# Methodology to access infrastructure

# **Hardening**

- a collection of tools and techniques to reduce vulnerability in the infrastructure or the systems unlike test maturity model is emphasizing on the automation process
- provides different protection layers
  - host level
  - application level
  - operating system level
  - user level to physical level

---

# Methodology

**Methodology to assess software development tool security are such as below:**
- **NIST framework**
- **NICE framework**
- **SAST vs DAST**

---

## NIST framework

![NIST framework](https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/styles/960_x_960_limit/public/images/2019/04/18/cyber-diagram-steps.png?itok=dI-k78Gp)

## NICE framework

---

## SAST vs DAST

| SAST | DAST|
|-------------------|------------------|
|White box security testing <br/>- Tester has access the underlying framework <br/>- Application tested from inside out <br/>- testing represent developer approach| Black box security testing<br/>- Tester has no knowledge of the framework or technologies <br/>-tested from outside in <br/>-testing represent hacker approach|

---

|SAST |DAST|
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Requires source code  -analyze source code or binary without executing the applications| Requires a running application -  analyze by executing the applications |
|Find vulnerabilities earlier in SDLC |Find vulnerabilities toward the end of SDLC|
|Less expensive to solve the vulnerabilities- problem can be solve before code enter to QA cycle| More expensive to solve the vulnerabilities -problem may be fixed as emergency release|
|can't discover run-time and environment-related issues scans static code| Can discover run-time and environment-related issues -using dynamic analysis|
|Support all kinds of software | Typically scan only application like web services and web application|

## OWASP DevSecOps Maturity model

- a guidelines to enable the organizations which progress in DevOps journey, to have a faster release cycles and digital innovation demands a strong pitch.
