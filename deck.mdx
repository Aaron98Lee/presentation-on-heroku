# **Apache Maven**

- Apache Maven is a comprehension and project management software tool.
- Based on a project object model (POM) framework,
- Maven is able to handle the create,
- report and documentation of a project from an information center.

---

We can create and manage any Java-based project through maven.

**Scope provided by Maven for developers to manage**
- Build
- Documentation
- Reporting
- Dependencies
- SCMs
- Releases
- Distribution
- Mailing List

# **Maven Goals used by Back End Repositories**
Maven following 3 standard lifecycle, which are:
- Clean
- build
- Site

**Clean** and **Build** lifecycle is in used by Back End Repositories

# **Maven Typical Build Lifecycle**

A Typical Build Lifecycle is a well-defined sequence of phases which define the order in which the goals are to be executed. A typical Maven Build Lifecycle is as table below:

|Phase|Handles|Description|
|--|--|--|
|**Prepare-resources**|Resource copying|Resource copying can be customized in this phase|
|**Validate**|Validating the information	|Validates if the project is correct and if all necessary information is available.|
|**Compile**|Compilation|Validates if the project is correct and if all necessary information is available.|
|**Test**|Testing|Tests the compiled source code suitable for testing framework.|
|**Package**|Packaging|This phase creates the JAR/WAR package as mentioned in the packaging in POM.xml.|
|**Install**|Installation|This phase installs the package in local/remote maven repository.|
|**Deploy**|Deploying|Copies the final package to the remote repository.|

---

### **Maven Build (Default) Lifecycle**
Default lifecycle is the primary lifecycle of Maven and is used to build application. Its phases are as below:

|Sr.No.|Lifecycle Phase & Description|
|--|--|
|1|**Validate** - Validates whether project is correct and all necessary information is available to complete the build process.|
|2|**Initialize** - Initializes build state, for example set properties.|
|3|**Generate-Sources** - Generate any source code to be included in compilation phase.|
|4|**Process-Sources** - Process the source code, for example, filter any value.|
|5|**Generate-Resources** - Generate resources to be included in the package.|
|6|**Process-Resources** - Copy and process the resources into the destination directory, ready for packaging phase.|
|7|**Compile** - Compile the source code of the project.|

---
|||
|--|--|
|8|**Process-Classes** - Post-process the generated files from compilation, for example to do bytecode enhancement/optimization on Java classes.|
|9|**Generate-Test-Sources** - Generate any test source code to be included in compilation phase.|
|10|**Process-Test-Sources** - Process the test source code, for example, filter any values.|
|11|**Test-Compile** - Compile the test source code into the test destination directory.|
|12|**Process-Test-Classes** - Process the generated files from test code file compilation.|
|13|**Test** - Run tests using a suitable unit testing framework (Junit is one).|
|14|**Prepare-Package** - Perform any operations necessary to prepare a package before the actual packaging.|
|15|**Package** - Take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR, WAR, or EAR file.|
|16|**Pre-Integration-Test** - Perform actions required before integration tests are executed. For example, setting up the required environment.|
|17|**Integration-Test** - Process and deploy the package if necessary into an environment where integration tests can be run.|
|18|**Post-Integration-Test** - Perform actions required after integration tests have been executed. For example, cleaning up the environment.|
|19|**Verify** - Run any check-ups to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria.|
|20|**Install** - Install the package into the local repository, which can be used as a dependency in other projects locally.|
|21|**Deploy** - Copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.|
