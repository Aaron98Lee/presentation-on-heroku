- child declare parantage in its POM
- Parent is unaware of child that's inheriting
- useful when parent POM consist of reusable content for another project

# **Multi-Modules Project --> Aggregator**

- can sequence build process of many projects
- specifies all the projects that can be build-managed together
- child POM unaware of aggregator POM
- Aggregator POM can have more than 1 child POM
- no inheritance of any content from aggregator POM
- useful for modular build & site those projects that should be managed together
